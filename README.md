## What is GNU Emacs?
[GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is a [free/libre](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) advanced, extensible, customizable, self-documenting editor - and more. It was created by GNU Project founder [Richard Stallman](https://stallman.org), based on the Emacs editor developed for Unix operating systems. GNU Emacs has been a central component of the GNU project and a flagship project of the free software movement. Its name has occasionally been shortened to GNUMACS. The tag line for GNU Emacs is "the extensible self-documenting text editor". With proper support from the underlying system, GNU Emacs is able to display files in multiple character sets, and has been able to simultaneously display most human languages since at least 1999.
